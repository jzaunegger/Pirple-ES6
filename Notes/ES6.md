# What is ES6?
* Ecma-Script 6, or the language specification that JavaScript Engines are built upon. Each web browser implments its own JavaScript version, which is why some web browsers have specific tools or features that other broswers may not support.
* ES6 is the most modern "verison" of features for JavaScript. It is a superset of ES5, meaining that any existing feature in ES5 will work in ES6. ES6 adds a lot of enhancements to JavaScript like destructuring, module packaging, class declaring, lexical block scoping and much more. Adds new functionality like promises, and array and string functions. While it may be new and beneficial, not all browsers support all functionality so its a good idea to compile ES6 into ES5 using tools like Babel.
