# Switch Statements
Switch statements are ways of evaluating a series of conditions in a compact way. This will evaluate the given value to match the series of declared expressions to determine which codeblock to execute. Default is the code that will execute if no matching expression is found.

```javascript

    var value = "Condition 1";

    switch(value){
        case "Condition 0":
            break;

        case "Condition 1":
            break;

        case "Condition 2":
            break;

        case "Condition N":
            break;

        default:
            break;

    }

```
