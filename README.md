# Pirple-ES6

This is the home for all of my work for the Keeping Up With the Javascripts: ES6. Here I will keep track of notes from the course, homework assingments, and projects related to the course. There is also some basic boilerplate code for a basic web page using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Just to note, these homework examples are using the NodeJS runtime to execute, so they do not need to be linked into a HTML page at all. They can be used if NodeJS is installed by using the following command.

"nodejs <filename>"
